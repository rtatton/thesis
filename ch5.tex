\chapter{Conclusions}

\par Applications like ShareTrace are fundamentally collaborative in that users exchange data amongst each other to achieve an objective or gain personal utility. Maintaining personal data ownership and privacy in this collaborative setting while ensuring architectural scalability and security is an ongoing challenge in the fields of machine learning and cloud computing \cite{Cano2015, Hsieh2017, Jonas2017, Singhvi2017}. Our formulation of risk propagation offers scalability and efficiency and is thus a viable candidate for real-world usage to estimate the spread of infectious diseases. Moreover, message reachability provides researchers and system designers the ability to quantify both the risk of an individual and the effects parameter values have on the efficiency and accuracy of risk propagation.
