\section{Evaluation}

%The value of \Cref{eq:reach} can be found by associating with each symptom score a unique identifier. If each actor maintains a log of the risk scores it receives, then the set of actors that receive the symptom score or a propagated risk score thereof can be identified. This set of actors defines the induced subgraph on which to compute \Cref{eq:reach} using a shortest-path algorithm \citep{Johnson1977}.
