\section{Reference Implementation}

A reference implementation of \cref{sec:asynchronous} is available on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/cwru-xlab/sharetrace-akka}}. Actors are implemented using the Akka toolkit\footnote{\url{https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.8.5/typed/index.html}}, which offers high performance for large-scale actor systems. Experimental results indicate that the reference implementation can reliably handle contact networks with 1 million individuals and 10 million contacts, which makes it ideal for small-scale experiments. In addition to using the Akka toolkit, several other optimizations are implemented:
\begin{itemize}
  \item To reduce the size of event logs and result files, individual actor identifiers follow zero-based numbering and event records are serialized using the Ion format\footnote{\url{https://amazon-ion.github.io/ion-docs}} with shortened field names.
  \item To reduce memory usage, FastUtil\footnote{\url{https://fastutil.di.unimi.it}} data structures are used, including a specialized integer-based JGraphT\footnote{\url{https://jgrapht.org}} graph implementation \citep{Michail2020}. Also, singletons \citep{Gamma1995}, primitive data types, and reference equality are preferred where feasible and do not impact readability.
  \item To reduce runtime and increase throughput, logging is performed asynchronously with Logback\footnote{\url{https://logback.qos.ch/index.html}} and the LMAX Disruptor\footnote{\url{https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor}}.
\end{itemize}

\Cref{fig:arrow-diagram} shows the dependencies among the application components. Contextualizing this implementation with prior implementations of the driver-monitor-worker (DMW) framework (see \cref{sec:dmw-framework}), \class{RiskPropagation} is the driver, \class{Monitor} is the monitor, and \class{User} is the worker. The key difference between this implementation and previous implementations of the DMW framework is that the workers are stateful, which is necessary for decentralization.

\Cref{sec:asynchronous} describes the behavior of \class{User} and \class{Contact}. In order to evaluate \class{RiskPropagation}, each \class{User} also logs the following types of \class{UserEvent}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \class{ContactEvent}: logged when the \class{User} receives an unexpired \class{ContactMessage}; contains the \class{User} identifier, the \class{Contact} identifier, and the contact time.
  \item \class{ReceiveEvent}: logged when the \class{User} receives an unexpired \class{RiskScoreMessage}; contains the \class{User} identifier, the \class{Contact} identifier, and the \class{RiskScoreMessage}.
  \item \class{UpdateEvent}: logged when the \class{User} updates its exposure score; contains the \class{User} identifier, the previous \class{RiskScoreMessage}, and the current \class{RiskScoreMessage}.
  \item \class{LastEvent}: logged when the \class{User} receives a \class{PostStop} Akka signal\footnote{\url{https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/actor-lifecycle.html\#stopping-actors}} after the \class{Monitor} has stopped; contains the \class{User} identifier and the time of logging the last event, besides \class{LastEvent}; used to detect the end time of message passing.
\end{itemize}
For reachability analysis, \class{RiskScoreMessage} contains the identifier of the \class{User} from which the message originated.

\class{Monitor} is an actor that is responsible for transforming the \class{ContactNetwork} into a collection of \class{User} actors and terminating when no \class{UpdateEvent} has occurred for a period of time. As with \class{User} actors, the \class{Monitor} logs several types of \class{LifecycleEvent}, the meanings of which should be self-explanatory:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \class{CreateUsersStart}
  \item \class{CreateUsersEnd}
  \item \class{SendRiskScoresStart}
  \item \class{SendRiskScoresEnd}
  \item \class{SendContactsStart}
  \item \class{SendContactsEnd}
  \item \class{RiskPropagationStart}
  \item \class{RiskPropagationEnd}
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\class{RiskPropagation} logs execution properties, creates an Akka \class{ActorSystem} that creates a \class{Monitor} actor and sends it a \class{RunMessage}, and then waits until the \class{ActorSystem} terminates. Each execution of \class{RiskPropagation} is associated with a unique key that is included in each event record as mapped diagnostic context (MDC)\footnote{\url{https://logback.qos.ch/manual/mdc.html}}.

The \class{Runner} specifies how \class{RiskPropagation} is created and invoked, usually through some combination of statically defined behavior and runtime configuration.

Finally, \class{Main} is the entry point into the application. It is responsible for parsing \class{Context}, \class{Parameters}, and \class{Runner} from configuration and invoking \class{Runner} with \class{Context} and \class{Parameters} inputs. \class{Context} makes application-wide information accessible, such as the system time and user time\footnote{System time is always the wall-clock time and is included in each logged event record. User time is configurable to either be the wall-clock time or fixed at the reference time. The latter is ensures that no \class{RiskScoreMessage} and \class{ContactMessage} expires across executions of \class{RiskPropagation}.}, a pseudorandom number generator, \class{Runner} configuration, and loggers. \class{Parameters}, as the name suggests, is a collection of parameters that modify the behavior of the \class{Monitor}, \class{User}, and \class{Contact}.

In order to analyze the logs that were generated during the execution of \class{RiskPropagation}, they are transformed into a tabular dataset as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Load the execution properties for all executions of \class{RiskPropagation} that are associated with the same configuration.
  \item Process the stream of event records with one \class{EventHandler} per execution of \class{RiskPropagation}.
  \item Collect the results from each \class{EventHandler} and store them in a file.
  \item To analyze different configurations of \class{RiskPropagation}, load multiple result files and augment the results of each \class{RiskPropagation} execution with its execution properties.
  \item Flatten the resulting data structure and store the tabular dataset.
\end{enumerate}

For evaluation, the following event handlers were implemented:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \class{Reachability}: aggregates \class{ReceiveEvent}s that involve a distinct sender and receiver to determine the influence set cardinality, source set cardinality, and message reachability of each \class{User}.
  \item \class{Runtimes}: aggregates \class{LifecycleEvent}s and \class{LastEvent}s to determine the runtime of creating \class{User}s, sending \class{ContactMessage}s, sending \class{RiskScoreMessage}s, message passing, and the overall execution of \class{RiskPropagation}. Message passing runtime is the time elapsed from the start of sending \class{RiskScoreMessage}s until the last \class{LastEvent}.
  \item \class{UserEventCounts}: aggregates \class{UserEvent}s to determine the frequency of each subtype for each \class{User}.
  \item \class{UserUpdates}: aggregates \class{UpdateEvent}s to determine the new exposure score of each \class{User} and the change in value.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Design}

The following research questions were the focus of evaluation:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How do the send coefficient and tolerance affect the accuracy and efficiency of risk propagation?
  \item Do the distributions of risk scores and contact times affect the runtime of risk propagation?
  \item How does the contact network topology affect the runtime of risk propagation?
\end{enumerate}

Several graphs

Barabasi-Albert graphs \citep{Barabasi1999} are parametrized by the order $n$, the initial order $n_0$, and the increase in size $m_0$ upon each incremental increase in order. The latter two parameters are determined by solving \cref{eq:barabasi-albert-optimization}, where $\fracpart(x)$ is the fractional part of a real number $x$.
\begin{argmini}{n_0, m_0}{\fracpart(m_0)}{\protect\label{eq:barabasi-albert-optimization}}{}
  \addConstraint{n_0}{\in \intInterval{1}{n - 1}}
  \addConstraint{m_0}{\in \intInterval{1}{n_0}}
  \addConstraint{m_0}{= \frac{2m - n_0 (n_0 - 1)}{2(n - n_0)}}
\end{argmini}
Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi $G_{n,m}$ random graphs \citep{Erdos1959} are parametrized by the order $n$ and the size $m$. Random regular graphs \citep{Kim2003} are parametrized by the order $n$ and, using the degree sum formula, the degree $d = \lfloor \frac{2m}{n} \rfloor$. Lastly, Watts-Strogatz graphs \citep{Watts1998} are parametrized by the order $n$, the rewiring probability $p$ and the number of nearest neighbors $k = d + (d \bmod 2)$, which must be even.
