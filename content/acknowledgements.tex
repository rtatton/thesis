\section*{Acknowledgments}
I am sincerely thankful to Dr. Erman Ayday and Dr. Youngjin Yoo for their mentorship and collaboration on the ShareTrace project and the various xLab endeavors. As a result of their generous support, I have learned about the challenges of distributed computing and the exciting prospects of applying decentralized and self-sovereign technologies to solve impactful problems. I believe that my experiences with Dr. Ayday and Dr. Yoo have significantly contributed to my first career opportunity at Amazon; and for that, I cannot thank them enough.
