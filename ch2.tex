\par Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a copious amount of research in mobile contact tracing solutions, most notably being the joint effort by Apple and Google \cite{AppleGoogle}. External reviews and surveys provide extensive comparison of existing solutions through the lenses of privacy, security, ethics, adversarial models, data management, scalability, interoperability, and more. References \cite{Ahmed2020} and \cite{Martin2020} provide thorough reviews of existing mobile contact tracing solutions with discussion of the techniques, privacy, security, and adversarial models. The former offers additional detail on the system architecture (i.e., centralized, decentralized, and hybrid), data management, and user concerns of existing solutions. Other notable reviews with similar discussion include \cite{Wen2020, Raskar2020, Cho2020, Dar2020, Lucivero2020}. Reference \cite{Kuhn2021} provides a formal framework for defining aspects of privacy for proximity-based contact tracing.
