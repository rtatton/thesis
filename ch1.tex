\chapter{Introduction}
\par ShareTrace is a privacy-preserving contact-tracing solution \cite{Ayday2021}. Unlike other approaches that rely on device proximity to detect human interaction, ShareTrace executes iterative message passing on a factor graph to estimate a user's marginal posterior probability of infection (MPPI). To indicate its similarity to belief propagation, we refer to the ShareTrace algorithm as \emph{risk propagation}. By considering both direct and indirect contact, \cite{Ayday2021} demonstrates that risk propagation is more effective than other proximity-based methods that only consider former.

\par Building upon the efforts by \cite{Ayday2021}, we provide an efficient and scalable formulation of risk propagation\footnote{\url{https://github.com/share-trace}} that utilizes asynchronous, concurrent message passing on a temporal graph \cite{Holme2012, Holme2015}. While message passing has been studied under specific epidemiological models \cite{Karrer2010, Li2021}, our formulation allows us to contextualize risk propagation as a novel usage of a temporal graph that does not require such assumptions to infer the transmission of disease. As a result, we introduce a form of reachability that can uniquely characterize the dynamics of message passing on a temporal graph. Our formulation of risk propagation aligns with its distributed extension, as introduced by \cite{Ayday2021}, which has connections to the actor model of concurrent computing \cite{Baker1977, Agha1986} and the ``think-like-a-vertex'' model of graph algorithms \cite{McCune2015}.

\par Our evaluation aims to (1) describe the efficiency of risk propagation on both synthetic and real-world temporal graphs; (2) validate the accuracy of our new form of reachability on both synthetic and real-world graphs; (3) and briefly quantify the scalability of this implementation of risk propagation on synthetic graphs. To keep the scope of this work focused, we defer to \cite{Ayday2021} on the privacy and security aspects of ShareTrace.
